Doctor Gandra and her staff(Veronica & Diana) are truly amazing, that's why I'm trying to figure out who idea is it to remove Veronica to another office. If it's not broke, don't touch it! As a patient when you walk in the doctor, it could be one of the most scariest place, but at the location you always walk into a smiling face by Veronica and Diana(and they always know you by name not a chart). Dr. Gandra and her staff is exceptional. KEEP THEM TOGETHER!",

We then started seeing Dr Vuppali and has been doing much better. He has other health problems (not related to his kidneys) and Dr Vuppali has been with us every step of the way... even when she didn't have to be. I would recommend her to anyone!!!!",

We talk family, kids, and other things during our visit. Dr. Vuppali has always shown a great care for my health and strives to give me the best care. I have complete confidence in her medical decisions for me.",

I noticed that her scores were almost too good to be true, so I was a bit skeptical, but made an appointment anyway. Fortunate for me she was able to see me the same day. Her bedside manner is very professional and caring. She is soft spoken and listens carefully as you describe your symptoms. I would certainly recommend Dr. V",
