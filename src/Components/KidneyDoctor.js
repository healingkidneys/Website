                    As many as 37 million Americans are living with some form of chronic kidney disease (CKD). If you are experiencing some symptoms such as bloody urine or increased urination, you must consult with an experienced nephrologist at The Healing Kidneys Institute of Houston. Our experienced staff can not only help treat kidney disease but also treat or prevent issues that lead to CKD such as diabetes and hypertension.

                <p className=" leading-relaxed mb-8" style={{ color: Colors.paragraphGray }}>
                    The kidneys play a vital role in our bodies. Both of our kidneys are responsible for removing waste from the blood, releasing hormones, and maintaining electrolyte balance.
                    <br /><br />
                    When you have issues with your kidneys, an experienced nephrologist may screen for protein in the urine, or check your blood pressure. Our office may order blood tests for creatine or nitrogen presence. Our nephrologists will also monitor dialysis treatment for patients whose kidneys can no longer cleanse the blood.

                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-8" style={{ color: Colors.paragraphGray }}>
                    When you visit your primary care doctor, the reasons for your ailments may still be unresolved after testing. So you may also be referred to a nephrologist if you have these issues:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 list-inside mb-8" style={{ color: Colors.paragraphGray }}>

                    <li>Chronic kidney stones</li>
                    <li>Protein and excessive blood in the urine</li>
                    <li>Advanced CKD</li>
                    <li>High blood pressure unresponsive to treatment</li>
                    <li>Foamy urine</li>
                    <li>Anemia - which also causes lethargy</li>
                    <li>Dry and itchy skin</li>
                    <li>Excessive nighttime urination</li>
                    <li>Swollen feet and ankles</li>
                </ul>

                {/* Blood Pressure Monitoring Section */}
                <p className=" leading-relaxed mb-8" style={{ color: Colors.paragraphGray }}>
                    Our nephrologists will monitor your high blood pressure because hypertension narrows the blood vessels.
                    This constriction damages the blood vessels in the kidneys and the rest of the body.
                    A damaged kidney wonâ€™t be able to remove extra bodily fluid or waste.
                    As a result, not only is the body poisoning itself, but your blood pressure will continue to rise and cause other problems.
                    According to The National Kidney Foundation, high blood pressure is the 2nd highest cause of kidney failure in the US.
